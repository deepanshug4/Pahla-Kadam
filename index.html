                      The mindset behind this platform is to provide an all in one place to everyone so that they can have a genuine online identity while easing their day to day work. </p>

                      <p style="line-height: 2rem;">This feature helps all the users to communicate with each other at an institutional level. <br>This not only enables everyone to look-out for people with same goals but also have a professional platform to connect and grow together. This also eliminates the problem of finding someone and having a platform to communicate.<br>
                      This will help all the stakeholders in the educational institutions to connect with whomever we want in an efficient and effective way.</p>

                      <p style="line-height: 2rem;">In today's world, being connected is the most important thing.<br>The better a person's connected the better opportunities they have. <br>And frankly, there are "n" number of platforms out there that can be used to network. But the biggest question is that are these platforms a <b>"100% valid"</b> or are they just another place for crime to boom.<br>
                      But we at Pahla Kadam, understand the necessity to connect and the need to be secure.<br>Therefore, our platform only allows genuine people and organizations that means all the profiles on the platform come with a Pahla Kadam promise of <b><i>genuineness</i></b>.<br>So, you make connections that matter. </p>

                      We at Pahla Kadam understand the importance of correct and updated information.<br>Therefore, we tried to build a mechanism where everyone can receive general updates by the administration or specific updates from the administration or section.<br>

                      <p style="line-height: 2rem;">Profiles are the most important thing that one needs to have in their bag. These are not only an online identity but they also act as a one-stop destination to know about someone.<br>These profiles are accessible by everyone and by spending a few minutes on them can give us a lot of information about the other person.<br>
                      These can also act as a filter in a selection process and having a good profile not only reflects confidence but also attract more people.<br>
                      Thus, we at Pahla Kadam want to give all the users an option to create a customized profile with a guarantee of genuineness.

                      But in today's world, this privacy generally gets compromised.
                      Thus, we at Pahla Kadam have tried to solve this age-old problem by providing a messaging system in our very platform so that no one has to part with their private information just for the sake of communication. <br>
                      Thus, in our messaging feature, you just have to connect with the other person and you can communicate directly without the need of sharing numbers or social media handles.
